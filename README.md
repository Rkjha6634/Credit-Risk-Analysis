# Credit-Risk-Analysis
In this project I focused on analyzing the credit risk to evaluate loan applications, aiming to identify key factors 
influencing loan defaults and improve lending decisions. I successfully completed this credit risk assessment project 
using both SQL and Python. Leveraging data analysis techniques, this dataset consisted of 30000 rows and 12 
columns I explored various aspects of loan data to gain insights into credit risk factors. Among the key findings, I 
identified that the average loan amount is approximately $9,572.82, with debt consolidation loans having the highest 
mean loan amount, with shorter employment histories associated with higher default rates, Individuals with a history 
of previous defaults ('Y') have a significantly higher default rate. Additionally, I analyzed default rates in relation to 
factors such as employment history and home ownership, uncovering valuable trends. My analysis also revealed that 
loan approval rates vary significantly based on loan intent. This project allowed me to develop strong skills in data 
analysis, SQL querying, and Python programming, enabling me to make informed lending decisions and 
contribute to risk assessment strategies. Based on the analysis several actionable recommendations were identified to 
reduce credit risk. Adjusting Loan Approval Criteria, provide financial education and support to borrowers, especially 
those with higher default risk factors, Developing or refining credit risk assessment models
